    <p class="about">
        When you work with us, you are part of a team of committed
        collaborators. All aspects of our software development process are
        integrated, interactive and agile. <br />
        Our approach unifies design, development and product management to
        create exceptional products. <br />
        We start each project by understanding your business goals, the userâ€™s
        needs and the product requirements.
        <br />
        Then we help translate them into effective and elegant solutions.

          Before we sign a contract or write a line of code or team will spend the
          necessary time needed to understand your product vision. <br />
          The outcome of this scoping session is proposal or high-level statement
          of work. <br />
          Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just
          the pieces you need.
